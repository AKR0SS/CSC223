# 10.22 NVCC Lab: Sorted Name List

Design a program named SortedNameList.java, which implements a list structure with linked list node (LLNode.java). Your SortedNameList ADT should have the following methods:
```
   add(Name name), 
   size(),
   isEmpty(),
   isFull(),  
   search(Name name) - returns index of the object(the first occurrence) in the list,  returns -1 if not found, 
   get(index) - returns the Name object in the specified index location, 
   remove(index), 
   remove(Name name) -remove all occurrences of the object(two name objects are considered as equal if both first name 
               and last are equal, ignore cases),  
   removeAll(), 
```
