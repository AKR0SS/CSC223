# 9.18 LAB: Sorting user IDs

Given a main() that reads user IDs (until -1), complete the quicksort() and partition() methods to sort the IDs in ascending order using the Quicksort algorithm, and output the sorted IDs one per line.

Ex. If the input is:
```
kaylasimms 
julia 
myron1994 
kaylajones 
-1
```
the output is:
```
julia 
kaylajones
kaylasimms
myron1994 
```
