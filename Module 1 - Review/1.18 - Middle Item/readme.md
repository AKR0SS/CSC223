# 1.18 LAB: Middle item

Given a sorted list of integers, output the middle integer. A negative number indicates the end of the input (the negative number is not a part of the sorted list). Assume the number of integers is always odd.

Ex: If the input is:

```2 3 4 8 11 -1 ``` (trailing blank space)

the output is:

```Middle item: 4```

The maximum number of list values for any test case should not exceed 9. If exceeded, output "Too many numbers".

Hint: First read the data into an array. Then, based on the array's size, find the middle item.
