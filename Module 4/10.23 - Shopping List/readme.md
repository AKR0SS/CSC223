# 10.23 NVCC Lab: Shopping List

Perhaps you've heard that it's a good idea to shop with a grocery list. But if youâ€™ve never created a receipt for your grocery list before, where do you start? For this assignment, you will complete a class representing a shopping list containing Items. Each Item will contain item name(String), quantity(int), and unit price(double). The shopping list will contain an array of Items along with various methods for accessing, modifying, and resizing the array. In addition, the shopping list should be sorted based on item names.

ShoppingList, as its name implies, is a list ADT to store grocery items. In this assignment, you are required to implement add and remove methods as specified in the template.
